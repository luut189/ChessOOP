## What is this?

This is another attempt to make a chess game in Java.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `engine`: the package to maintain sources related to the Chess engine
    
    - `gfx`: the package to maintain sources related to the GUI

    - `App.java`: the main class
- `res`: the folder to maintain sprites for rendering

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder and ignored by `.gitignore` by default.

## Chess, again?

This time, I make it using **Object-Oriented Programming** and hope that it doesn't turn out to be garbage like the other one.
